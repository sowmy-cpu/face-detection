# face-detection
Face Recognition using open cv: This is a project related to machine learning using opencv libraries. My project will first take the training data and decides whether there is a face in that image or not and then it labels the training images. Now we'll train the LBPH(local binary pattern histogram) algorithm with the training data and their labels. Finally we will send the test data and if the test data is matching with the image of training data the label of training data is given to the test data. There are many applications of this project. we can use this to detect whether a person has license or not by checking if his image his present in data base of licensed people. Also, we can use this for attendance purpose also!
